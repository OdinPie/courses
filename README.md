*Project Features:

This project is based on a course registration platform. It has basic registration functionalities such as-
  * Provides Course details, Credit hour and price
  * Users can select courses and add them to cart
  * the cart shows remaining credits and total credits where a user can enroll into     maximum of 20 credits

*State Management:

I have used three states
    * to store courses
    * to keep track of total credits
    * to keep track of remaining credits
All of the states are triggered when the 'select' button is entered.
